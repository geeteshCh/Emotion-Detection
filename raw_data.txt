 Seasons 1-6: outstanding. 7: daft but good. 8: disappointing
 
dholliday-imdb21 May 2019


Let's say you're reading these reviews and haven't watched GoT yet, but now that it's finished are considering the marathon. What's the consensus? In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.Season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.Season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.The biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.So can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not. It could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:Battlestar Galactica (2003-2008)Twin Peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)Breaking Bad

 Can you just make the remake the season finale?
 
SaifOVGU9 April 2020


I'm feeling so heartbroken to see everyone criticising my favourite show of all time. And yes of course that's because of the bad making of the season finale, I can totally understand that. After all these years hardwork, creating and developing each and every character from bottom to top, memories, emotions throughout the process all went to vain for one bad making. It's so painful to accept it for the audience who invested lots of time watching the show from the starting and then finishing it like this! It's a long long journey. I don't even remember the day I started watching it and since then I waited the next year to come for the new season. I can't say anything more. Only one last request, could you please delete the whole season 8 and make a new version of it? Please?

 A perfect example of: Falling in Love with the Wrong Guy
 
samxxx-671-82622125 May 2019


It was a master piece. It was written to the perfection. It was mesmerizing. It was gripping. It was so shocking that if someone is binge watching this show he/she will need a time-off in between to get their head around things and accept some messed up, yet mind blowing development.But yet, I cant hate it enough after final season. Its like you came to know that you were in love with the wrong one all along. It was like looking at a completely different person. It was like seeing your own dreams and expectations get destroyed. It was not a let down, it was a BETRAYAL!

 This is a television show?
 
TheLittleSongbird9 November 2017


Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? The good news is that 'Game of Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. A television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. This is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.Visually, 'Game of Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about 'Game of Thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.Whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. They're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.Characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'Game of Thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.'Game of Thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'Game of Thrones' is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox

 Game of Thrones
 
jacobnoble-0252410 May 2019

Warning: Spoilers










I would give this an easy 10/10.. if season 8 didn't exist. But it does, unfortunately.Season 1-6 10/10 Amazing, complex dialogue and intriguing logical story lines with strong character developments and shocking emotional moments. On top of the insane action scenes. A few MINOR flaws in s5/6Season 7- 7/10 - still good but seemed rushed and had some illogical moments that made no sense.Season 8- 3/10 I actually don't know where or start. Season 8 is a joke. Terrible writing. Nothing makes sense. The writers have butchered many character's developments and given hardly any satisfying conclusions to their story arcs. Brans story had no pay off at all and his whole role as the 3 eyed raven proved pointless against the Night King. Jaime's redemption arc was cut off instantly with real no reason. The Night Kings death was underwhelming. Infact all of episode 3 was poor, with no real structure and poorly written end to the main story line of the show. No Sansa and Cersei interaction of any sort which I would have liked to have seen. Unbelievable unrealistic plot armour. The plot armour ruined the battle of Winterfell. 'All' the Dothraki wiped out in seconds yet Samwell Tarly can fend them off. Many more characters needed to die that episode. Rhaegal taken down by first 3 shots, yet Drogon dodges an Iron fleets worth of Scorpions at Kings Landing, which weren't even shooting, just to serve the plot. I guess Euron forgot about Dany's dragon and her forces. Jon does nothing all season (why was he resurrected? ). Speaking of Jon, what was the point of his lineage? It didn't change anything. I kind of like Danaerys going mad but it needed a lot more time and thought put into it - It went too far too fast with no substantial development to justify her killing thousands of innocents. It was actually laughable. Needed seasons of planning and transitioning her character. After Dany's death it just skipped to Tyrion's trial and no one seemed phased over it. Anything that required any thought from the Writers was done off screen, like Arya and Sansa finding out about Jon's lineage. Major let downs and bad dialogue throughout. There are some good moments but very few and far between. Have to appreciate effort by cast, directing and music crew and the few decent scenes as a whole. Also, Cersei, who I personally think is the most interesting character gets 20 minutes screen time all season and does nothing except look out of a window.Overall- 8/10 purely on S1-7

 Shame of Thrones
 
type-a1pha24 May 2019


The ending of this series is a disservice to the public!The first seasons are great as they are based on the books source material and, apparently, the writers are good enough at adapting other people ideas. After season four there's a decline, not so manifest at first since the goodness of the source material still lingers around. It's more of a slow deterioration, a spiral into shallow writing that peaks in a last season devoid of content and value.
Where at first grand scale developments, societal issues and world-spanning intrigues dominated the narration with characters being the pawns of the true overarching story, later in the seasons characters and stereotypical interactions take the stage and the interesting, long developing issues that made the story captivating get resolved in the most unrewarding ways possible. It's incoherent, detached, uninspired writing. It's everything that is bad in mainstream media.All of this because the writers decided they had enough with the show and grew bored with it. So they wanted to wrap it up as soon as possible in order to go on and ruin the Star Wars franchise (more than it already is). Thanks for your disservice!It needs to be mentioned that the overall production, sound design, acting, cinematography, all of these are quite extraordinary and elevate the show quite a bit, even when the writing declines. The quality is amazing. It probably is still worth watching for its entertainment value. It just doesn't pay off. The ending season ruins quite literally everything.

 Imagine an Ice Cream Shop
 
kunkell2 November 2019


So imagine you go into an ice cream shop and you order a sundae. They've got all kinds of nice stuff going on, beautiful delicious soft serve vanilla bean ice cream, some hot fudge, freshly cracked up peanuts, woah what is that?? A brownie? Some delicious house made whipped cream... Man this sundae is gonna be spectacular. Wow what more could you ask for? Cherry on top? Bring it on!!And then all of a sudden they put an anchovy on top, and then another, and then a couple more, and then squirt some Dijon mustard on for good measure.You don't even want the sundae anymore, in fact, you can't even look back on how nice that sundae used to be without thinking about all the stupid s*** they did at the very end just when it was going so well.That's essentially Game of Thrones. I tried to rewatch it, but as I got through the first season I began looking at where all the pieces land at the end it's literally impossible to go back to. There are just so many ruined character arcs, so much pointlessness, and every time I come back here I drop it one more star it seems like. Game of Thrones is a beautiful anchovy sundae.

 It could have been the best TV series ever made...
 
danielkpkp12 May 2020


Till season 7 very likely the best TV show ever made in terms of suspense, character development, plot, effects, acting.... 10/10 with no doubt! But S6E10 is probably the point where you should stop and imagine your own ending. It is guaranteed better and has more character development. Otherwise you may end up rating it down by more than just one and are overcome by disappointment...

 Fantasy has never seemed so real
 
gogoschka-122 July 2014


I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.'Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. Every "country", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. Of course, that was all already there in the books – but translating that so perfectly to a TV-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement.Yet for all its grandeur, scale and breath-taking visuals, what really makes Martin's outstanding work come to life on the small screen is the fantastic ensemble of actors. At the core of this show (any show, really) are the characters. Tyrion, Cersei, Dany, Jamie and John (and all the – many – others) don't lose anything of their complexity; the amazing cast succeeds in showing all their respective characters' inner conflicts and often questionable motivations and virtually no one comes across as one-dimensional (except maybe for Joffrey).There have been a couple of great TV-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale AND quality, 'Game of Thrones' is – at the moment – in a league of its own. A joy to watch: breath-taking, epic – and highly addictive – Television. 10 stars out of 10.Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/

 A once terrific show bogged down due to horrible writing.
 
CriticalOfEverything17 May 2019


Game of Thrones used to be one of my favourite shows on television. It was the perfect fantasy story with complex and detailed stories with characters that you actually cared about, along with simply fantastic writing and good acting with a great sense of tension. However, ever since Season 4 ended, the show has taken a rather significant hit in quality, and it soon went from being fantastic to good and then good to straight up idiotic. While Season 5 and 6 weren't the worst, and Season 7 didn't really have my blood boiling, there was a definitely recognisable change in the writing and plots. It stopped being as sophisticated and became straight up average. All that was saving it was the other good things about the show like the visuals, characters, tension and drama. But now we're here, at the final season:Game of Thrones Season 8 is one of the worst seasons of any TV show I have ever watched in my entire life. It throws everything you ever cared about with this show out the window for cheap expectation subversions, it completely shatters and throws aside character arcs that you have wanted resolved, it completely destroys many of the characters you once loved, the writing has gotten to a whole new level of atrocious with D&D giving excuses like "Oh they just forgot about them" to justify it, it is filled with plot holes and contrivances, ex-machinas, and so many impressively dumb moments and deaths that make The Last Jedi look like Citizen Kane. This is The Last Jedi of GOT, it ruins everything you have ever loved about it, it disregards the fact that you have loved this show for nearly a decade just so it can get away with wrapping up the story in a way that even the actors of the damn show hate.I have never seen a TV show get affected by Seasonal rot THIS HARD. A once truly terrific show bogged down due to horrible writing, and they're not even going to up their game for the ending. Years of watching this show that I'll never be able to get back. Thanks D&D, or should we start calling you Dumb and Dumber? Try not to ruin Star Wars next.

 Excellent adaptation.
 
psypeterson17 April 2011

Warning: Spoilers










Readers who come to this review later in the series must note that, at the time of this writing, I have only seen the inaugural episode. It's probably safe to say, when dealing with a series of novels as beloved as The Song of Ice and Fire, the most scrutinized aspect of the T.V. adaptation will be how well it holds to the source material. I am here to confirm, as a fierce devotee to the books, that we have nothing to fear.While certain scenes play out differently in execution, the plot remains perfectly intact (so far). The characters have been transplanted well from page to screen, and the actors (most notably Peter Dinklage) nailed their personalities quite well. However; it is only fair to point out some of the acting seemed a little wooden at times.Special effects were well done, though nothing mind-blowing, but the scenery and props perfectly captured the feel of the novels (in my mind at least). It also must be noted that there was just the right amount of nudity, violence and vulgarity to let the audience know they were watching a tale woven for mature viewers without using said nudity, violence and vulgarity as a crutch.All and all, I am very, very pleased with this adaptation, and I went into it expecting to be disappointed. If I were to gripe about anything, it would be that newcomers who have not read the books might not know what to think of this fantasy story for adults. Some may shrug it off as fodder for geeks, while others might take offence to what they may see as a defiling of a genre usually meant for children.UPDATEAfter watching the entire first season, I can safely say this is perhaps the BEST adaptation of book into film/TV. While many moments in the show do not match the moments in the book action for action and word for word, the plot is never sacrificed when doing this, and the alterations simply make the story a better fit for a one-hour television time slot.In addition, new scenes (by which I mean scenes which never happened in the book at all) fit seamlessly into the greater plot, and help the audience with information they would only otherwise get via the narrative of the novel (EG: asides which explain character/world history).Top form, HBO. Top form.

At first I did not want to watch the series.
But once I started watching it, I couldn't stop.
It became more and more exciting from season 1-8.Great actors.I was disappointed with the end of the 8 season!

 A scary harbinger of the future
 
FlorianLaur3 May 2019

Warning: Spoilers










Despite having magic, dragons and supernatural creatures in it, it was much more plot- and character-driven. Most of the charme came from smart conversations, like in Jackie Brown(imho the best Tarantino movie, yet underrated because it doesn't have much action).One can say that I liked the show because it was different.
It didn't mind to break with conventions, it didn't pander to what the majority expected and it didn't show you everything (like the battles), which made the few scenes with some sword fights all the more powerful.Then came season 4 and season 5. The show started to slip and fast. Basically with the death of Tywin Lannister, it said goodbye to everything that made it once great. The 2 best schemers(Varys and Littlefinger) who could have a show of their own and set in motion 90% of the plot left King's Landing and hardly had any role in the show anymore.
The interesting characters with edges and flaws were killed off because the creators didn't like them(Stannis). The way that was done was an insult to anyone who kept watching after that.The big threat that we should worry about were always the zombie-like creatures up north. Who are they? Where do they come from? Why do they want to kill everyone?
Don't hope for answers. The "big threat" is dealt with in one episode, of course without answers.

 A long time coming
 
kosmasp2 January 2020


So I succesfully avoided major spoilers about the show and could binge watch this since the complete Box set came out in early December. The first season was a bit overwhelming, what with all the houses and characters thrown at you. As you may be able to tell, I have not read the source material. Not sure who of the cast had read it beforehand either. So bare that in mind.Now the line Winter is coming is something everyone associates with the show, I just never expected this to come up so early in the show. What is surprising, at least during the first seasons of the show, is how many supposedly main characters fail to survive. This keeps the viewers on their tows. Towards the end of the show this gets a bit watered down. Not sure how much influence the original author had there (he had only written material for the first 6 seasons of the show, the rest was made up).Having said that, you can feel a drop in quality. And while I have friend who thought the second season was boring (it's a bit of a travelling show and things get stretched quite a bit), if he continued to watch, he might feel even worse with the last seasons. Even though they are shorter (episode wise, not time wise per episode), they feel stretched even more.Also the conclusion (no worries, I'm not telling) is anticlimatic to say the least. It feels bad and the continuity errors are just thrown aside. So if not for the epic battles and the actors, who are all really amazing in this, I might have gone farther down with my vote. Then again, if it wasn't for the last season specifically, I might have given it a 10 too ... A prequel show has been axed for now (not sure if the bad reviews and or numbers for the last season played a role), but I would watch it. This achieved overall something that "The Reign" could not: combine violence, fantasy and nudity into something mature/adult that works for men and women watching

 A Need Fulfilled
 
Hitchcoc6 January 2018


I am writing this because according to the IMDB User Ratings, I have not commented. I have reviewed all the individual episodes, but not the show as a whole. There is little that I can add to the impact of this show. I am proud to be on the same planet as those who created and put this work into fruition. When one looks at the technical accomplishments and the multiple plot strains that have been kept in balance, it is truly a wonder. I know that there are those who can never get past the "book did this" and "the book did that." We have to come to realize that it is impossible to recreate every nuance that fiction allows and that occasionally characters must be dropped and events assumed. For me, I have approached these as the artistic creations they are--as film (and television, at that). I have the books. I've not read them but plan to at some point. I doubt at this late stage of my life there will ever be another series to match this. I like fantasy but am not ruled by it as a genre. But this is for us all. If you've not seen it, treat yourself.

 "There's nothing more powerful in the world than a good story." - Tyrion Lannister, Episode #8.6
 
classicsoncall13 September 2021

Warning: Spoilers










With over five thousand reviews already posted here for "Game of Thrones", there's really nothing I think I could add to indicate what an epic, kingdom spanning series this turned out to be. As is often the case, I'm late to the party for this program, but on the flip side, I was able to watch the entire series relatively uninterrupted over a span of a few weeks. The story telling and characters are spell binding, with twists that sometimes come out of nowhere that leave you gasping. Not even the principals are immune, leading characters are often discarded just as you were beginning to relate to them, and often in a manner that's nasty and bloody. For a series this massive in scope, it would be hard to pick out a favorite character; up until the last season mine would have been Daenerys Targaryen Stormborn (Emilia Clarke), with Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) a pretty close second. I think the reason so many folks were dismayed by the eighth and final season was because it ended by going against the grain of most viewers' expectation that Jon Snow (Kit Harington) would emerge as the King of the Seven Kingdoms, or at least a co-ruler with Daenerys. My own feeling gravitated toward Brandon the Broken (Isaac Hempstead Wright) around the time he became the Three Eyed Raven. If you haven't seen this series yet, you might be intrigued enough to catch it after learning what Cersei Lannister (Leana Heady) stated to Ned Stark (Sean Bean) in Episode #1.7 - "When you play the game of thrones, you win, or you die."

 One of the best shows ever created!
 
Supermanfan-1312 June 2022


I know that people say this about a ton of different shows but Game of Thrones is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best TV shows ever created...it's damn near perfect (except for maybe the last few episodes) and easily one of my all-time favorite shows! Yeah, the last few episodes of Season 8 weren't that good and the ending was just awful, but the first 7 1/2 seasons were so amazing that it still gets a 10 from me! I'm pretty sure there's never been a show more talked about or more loved in the history of television than GOT. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is! Again, this show is absolutely amazing!

 Game of Retcons
 
RebelPanda14 May 2019


Game of Thrones will go down in history as the greatest decline in writing quality of all time.I used to love this show, the story, characters, the sprawling setting. It's one of the first series that really made me care and root for the characters. Even the irredeemably evil ones were still exciting to watch.But that all changed with the final season. Unless you have been living under a rock for the past year, its commonly known that George RR Martin has not released his final book of the franchise. The final two seasons were all HBO original content, and they could maintain the story in passable quality during the seventh season. However, when it came to ending the story it is rushed, anticlimactic, and immeasurably disappointing.Characters started acting stupid, or just entirely unlike themselves. Loved heroes become confusingly insane, they lost all semblance of motivations from past seasons and suddenly became totally different people. The writer's excuse? A new motivation from past seasons is written in to skip development, in other words, retcons galore.The dialogue became inanely simplistic or just repetitive and boring. So little of importance is ever said. Characters just stare off in the distance vacantly, then occasionally they make the most observances that anyone could have inferred on their own. What happened to the complex script full of setups, payoffs, and humanly written characters?The only thing left to do now is scrub the awful ending out of my head by rewatching the past six seasons. Then I'll wait for George RR Martin to release the true ending because this is an absolute disgrace. D&D spit in the faces of millions of GOT fans. The best recommendation I can give this show is to watch the first six seasons (and the seventh if you want to test your patience) then forget about season eight.

 Fallen From the Skies
 
Tweetienator9 May 2019

Warning: Spoilers










I will make it short - the first five seasons are top-notch and the show really entertained and got me for those years and was imo always exceptional, best of the best so to say, and a new milestone in making a tv-show.Both Season 6 and 7 could not hold the level of the first five seasons, but were still okay, but season 8 is a really bad thing and a steep drop in quality regarding storytelling: too blunt, too boring (because predictable) and on top too many mistakes occur - just too many to ingnore and not to notice. Also the killing of the Night King is a rather poor choice of execution.And why our beloved Dragon Queen does not just circle the fleet and burn them to ashes from behind may be a mystery for ever (all ships just had catapults on the front/bow). Or e.g. mysterioulsy half of the armies of the allies somehow survived the battle against the undead (following the shown battle it looked like nobody but a very few survived - not to mention all those bad strategic choices in battle and in preperation for the battle).Anyway, gone are the times with many interesting characters and exotic places and plots over plots, and therefore it is a good thing that this is the last season and the curtains will be closed for good.
Also, I should add, I tuned down my hopes a lot for the upcoming prequel show. I fear we will get something rather ordinary. Hopefully, Mr. Martin provides us a better finale to his Game of Thrones.Ratings:
Season 1 to 5 = 9
Season 6 to 7 = 7
Season 8 = 4 (ep 4 aired)Addition: the resolution of the show - what a predictable, boring and cliched mess... years and years of a fine show and then we get this big RUSHED let-down. Just terrible. Last note: I thought I would buy all seasons on dvd, instead I sold the ones I already got...

 One of the best show I have watched
 
nneelakandan4 November 2021


Game of thrones is the show I have got hooked up with. A fabulous storyline, fantastic characters, brilliant performance from actors makes a show a masterpiece. Peter dinklage was my favorite he plays the character was a awesome treat to watch. My disappointing in this series is the ending.
