Review :Let's say reading reviews watched GoT yet, finished considering marathon. What's consensus? In case, consensus accurate, is:Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT worth watching seasons, definitely.Season 7: suddenly notice writing plotting taken sharp dive downwards quality. There inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation soap-opera dramas. But least entertainment value still high, gets pass.Season 8: drop chasms depths think possible. The writing got amateurish still-fantastic production values longer enough save it. If ever enjoyed Lost amazed bad final season was, familiar territory here.The biggest problem final season took us story got us thinking many weaknesses. We lost suspension disbelief. Fatal fiction. It also ruined series-arcs point rewatch entire series pointless.So I recommend GoT marathon newcomers? Yes, first 6 seasons worth disappointments later on. But best series time not. It could've been, dropping ball final stretch puts behind following superior series worthy marathon:Battlestar Galactica (2003-2008)Twin Peaks (all 3 seasons, plus movie)Breaking Bad

Review :I'm feeling heartbroken see everyone criticising favourite show time. And yes course that's bad making season finale, I totally understand that. After years hardwork, creating developing every character bottom top, memories, emotions throughout process went vain one bad making. It's painful accept audience invested lots time watching show starting finishing like this! It's long long journey. I even remember day I started watching since I waited next year come new season. I can't say anything more. Only one last request, could please delete whole season 8 make new version it? Please?

Review :Was over-time gradual binge watching 'Game Thrones' first episode (gradual busy), heard nothing amazing things friends, family IMDb reviewers. Plus great cast talent brilliant book series, could possibly go wrong? The good news 'Game Thrones' go wrong. Quite opposite. Not rare television show original source material justice treats respect merits one finest, addictive consistently compelling shows recent years. A television show brilliant one actually check made television everything done high level puts many films made today shame. This one strongest examples acclaimed show deserves every ounce praise garnered.Visually, 'Game Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery throughout spectacular, sets hugely atmospheric beautiful eyes real meticulous eye detail costumes suit characters tee. Then special effects best television programme overused abused, scale, detail actually character soul better lot big-budget blockbusters. As well cinematography editing, cinematic quality well.One cannot talk 'Game Thrones' without mentioning thematically, orchestrally atmospherically multi-layered music scoring unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It hard bowled quality writing, outstanding strong enough adjective describe good writing is. It always natural flow, layered thought-provoking demonstrates wide range emotions suspenseful tension, poignant pathos witty humour. The story-lines paced beautifully, structured nuance attention coherence, high emotional level touch upon complex sensitive themes intelligence tact.Whenever there's set-piece action-oriented scene there's always reason, never sake it. Not set-pieces done lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement dramatic tension underneath scale flashy attention detail lot heart multi-layered one. They're overlong, place elements.Characters huge part appeal too. 'Game Thrones' characters well developed close real life one get despite fantasy world. These characters hero villain archetypes (Joffrey one close that, difference though extremely interesting one lot development ranks well beyond one hundred percent threat level scale), much strengths flaws. Decisions logical one like character less decision right one mistakes acknowledged learnt from.'Game Thrones' cast full talented names and, thanks well rounded characters great writing, nothing best gotten them. Even favourites mine. Big acting standouts Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey Jack Gleeson (Joffrey king young characters redeeming bone body).In conclusion, absolutely outstanding rare television show worthy cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, 'Game Thrones' good. 10/10 Bethany Cox

Review :I would give easy 10/10.. season 8 exist. But does, unfortunately.Season 1-6 10/10 Amazing, complex dialogue intriguing logical story lines strong character developments shocking emotional moments. On top insane action scenes. A MINOR flaws s5/6Season 7- 7/10 - still good seemed rushed illogical moments made sense.Season 8- 3/10 I actually know start. Season 8 joke. Terrible writing. Nothing makes sense. The writers butchered many character's developments given hardly satisfying conclusions story arcs. Brans story pay whole role 3 eyed raven proved pointless Night King. Jaime's redemption arc cut instantly real reason. The Night Kings death underwhelming. Infact episode 3 poor, real structure poorly written end main story line show. No Sansa Cersei interaction sort I would liked seen. Unbelievable unrealistic plot armour. The plot armour ruined battle Winterfell. 'All' Dothraki wiped seconds yet Samwell Tarly fend off. Many characters needed die episode. Rhaegal taken first 3 shots, yet Drogon dodges Iron fleets worth Scorpions Kings Landing, even shooting, serve plot. I guess Euron forgot Dany's dragon forces. Jon nothing season (why resurrected? ). Speaking Jon, point lineage? It change anything. I kind like Danaerys going mad needed lot time thought put - It went far fast substantial development justify killing thousands innocents. It actually laughable. Needed seasons planning transitioning character. After Dany's death skipped Tyrion's trial one seemed phased it. Anything required thought Writers done screen, like Arya Sansa finding Jon's lineage. Major let downs bad dialogue throughout. There good moments far between. Have appreciate effort cast, directing music crew decent scenes whole. Also, Cersei, I personally think interesting character gets 20 minutes screen time season nothing except look window.Overall- 8/10 purely S1-7

Review :Where first grand scale developments, societal issues world-spanning intrigues dominated narration characters pawns true overarching story, later seasons characters stereotypical interactions take stage interesting, long developing issues made story captivating get resolved unrewarding ways possible. It's incoherent, detached, uninspired writing. It's everything bad mainstream media.All writers decided enough show grew bored it. So wanted wrap soon possible order go ruin Star Wars franchise (more already is). Thanks disservice!It needs mentioned overall production, sound design, acting, cinematography, quite extraordinary elevate show quite bit, even writing declines. The quality amazing. It probably still worth watching entertainment value. It pay off. The ending season ruins quite literally everything.

Review :I believe ever anything like 'Game Thrones' TV. The sheer amount quality talent series staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL actors), costumes, visual effects, make-up: everybody working show seems wanted make Television-history. And writing phenomenal.'Game Thrones' may belong 'Fantasy' genre, world Westeros surrounding lands amazingly well thought inhabited characters well drawn credible everything watch feels real. Every "country", every city, tribe family richly detailed history even mythology never feels like made up. Of course, already books – translating perfectly TV-show care done really rare achievement.Yet grandeur, scale breath-taking visuals, really makes Martin's outstanding work come life small screen fantastic ensemble actors. At core show (any show, really) characters. Tyrion, Cersei, Dany, Jamie John (and – many – others) lose anything complexity; amazing cast succeeds showing respective characters' inner conflicts often questionable motivations virtually one comes across one-dimensional (except maybe Joffrey).There couple great TV-shows last years, comes scale AND quality, 'Game Thrones' – moment – league own. A joy watch: breath-taking, epic – highly addictive – Television. 10 stars 10.Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Favorite Low-Budget B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/

Review :Game Thrones used one favourite shows television. It perfect fantasy story complex detailed stories characters actually cared about, along simply fantastic writing good acting great sense tension. However, ever since Season 4 ended, show taken rather significant hit quality, soon went fantastic good good straight idiotic. While Season 5 6 worst, Season 7 really blood boiling, definitely recognisable change writing plots. It stopped sophisticated became straight average. All saving good things show like visuals, characters, tension drama. But we're here, final season:Game Thrones Season 8 one worst seasons TV show I ever watched entire life. It throws everything ever cared show window cheap expectation subversions, completely shatters throws aside character arcs wanted resolved, completely destroys many characters loved, writing gotten whole new level atrocious D&D giving excuses like "Oh forgot them" justify it, filled plot holes contrivances, ex-machinas, many impressively dumb moments deaths make The Last Jedi look like Citizen Kane. This The Last Jedi GOT, ruins everything ever loved it, disregards fact loved show nearly decade get away wrapping story way even actors damn show hate.I never seen TV show get affected Seasonal rot THIS HARD. A truly terrific show bogged due horrible writing, they're even going game ending. Years watching show I'll never able get back. Thanks D&D, start calling Dumb Dumber? Try ruin Star Wars next.

Review :Readers come review later series must note that, time writing, I seen inaugural episode. It's probably safe say, dealing series novels beloved The Song Ice Fire, scrutinized aspect T.V. adaptation well holds source material. I confirm, fierce devotee books, nothing fear.While certain scenes play differently execution, plot remains perfectly intact (so far). The characters transplanted well page screen, actors (most notably Peter Dinklage) nailed personalities quite well. However; fair point acting seemed little wooden times.Special effects well done, though nothing mind-blowing, scenery props perfectly captured feel novels (in mind least). It also must noted right amount nudity, violence vulgarity let audience know watching tale woven mature viewers without using said nudity, violence vulgarity crutch.All all, I very, pleased adaptation, I went expecting disappointed. If I gripe anything, would newcomers read books might know think fantasy story adults. Some may shrug fodder geeks, others might take offence may see defiling genre usually meant children.UPDATEAfter watching entire first season, I safely say perhaps BEST adaptation book film/TV. While many moments show match moments book action action word word, plot never sacrificed this, alterations simply make story better fit one-hour television time slot.In addition, new scenes (by I mean scenes never happened book all) fit seamlessly greater plot, help audience information would otherwise get via narrative novel (EG: asides explain character/world history).Top form, HBO. Top form.

Review :So I succesfully avoided major spoilers show could binge watch since complete Box set came early December. The first season bit overwhelming, houses characters thrown you. As may able tell, I read source material. Not sure cast read beforehand either. So bare mind.Now line Winter coming something everyone associates show, I never expected come early show. What surprising, least first seasons show, many supposedly main characters fail survive. This keeps viewers tows. Towards end show gets bit watered down. Not sure much influence original author (he written material first 6 seasons show, rest made up).Having said that, feel drop quality. And I friend thought second season boring (it's bit travelling show things get stretched quite bit), continued watch, might feel even worse last seasons. Even though shorter (episode wise, time wise per episode), feel stretched even more.Also conclusion (no worries, I'm telling) anticlimatic say least. It feels bad continuity errors thrown aside. So epic battles actors, really amazing this, I might gone farther vote. Then again, last season specifically, I might given 10 ... A prequel show axed (not sure bad reviews numbers last season played role), I would watch it. This achieved overall something "The Reign" could not: combine violence, fantasy nudity something mature/adult works men women watching

Review :I writing according IMDB User Ratings, I commented. I reviewed individual episodes, show whole. There little I add impact show. I proud planet created put work fruition. When one looks technical accomplishments multiple plot strains kept balance, truly wonder. I know never get past "book this" "the book that." We come realize impossible recreate every nuance fiction allows occasionally characters must dropped events assumed. For me, I approached artistic creations are--as film (and television, that). I books. I've read plan point. I doubt late stage life ever another series match this. I like fantasy ruled genre. But us all. If seen it, treat yourself.

Review :Game Thrones go history greatest decline writing quality time.I used love show, story, characters, sprawling setting. It's one first series really made care root characters. Even irredeemably evil ones still exciting watch.But changed final season. Unless living rock past year, commonly known George RR Martin released final book franchise. The final two seasons HBO original content, could maintain story passable quality seventh season. However, came ending story rushed, anticlimactic, immeasurably disappointing.Characters started acting stupid, entirely unlike themselves. Loved heroes become confusingly insane, lost semblance motivations past seasons suddenly became totally different people. The writer's excuse? A new motivation past seasons written skip development, words, retcons galore.The dialogue became inanely simplistic repetitive boring. So little importance ever said. Characters stare distance vacantly, occasionally make observances anyone could inferred own. What happened complex script full setups, payoffs, humanly written characters?The thing left scrub awful ending head rewatching past six seasons. Then I'll wait George RR Martin release true ending absolute disgrace. D&D spit faces millions GOT fans. The best recommendation I give show watch first six seasons (and seventh want test patience) forget season eight.

Review :With five thousand reviews already posted "Game Thrones", there's really nothing I think I could add indicate epic, kingdom spanning series turned be. As often case, I'm late party program, flip side, I able watch entire series relatively uninterrupted span weeks. The story telling characters spell binding, twists sometimes come nowhere leave gasping. Not even principals immune, leading characters often discarded beginning relate them, often manner that's nasty bloody. For series massive scope, would hard pick favorite character; last season mine would Daenerys Targaryen Stormborn (Emilia Clarke), Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) pretty close second. I think reason many folks dismayed eighth final season ended going grain viewers' expectation Jon Snow (Kit Harington) would emerge King Seven Kingdoms, least co-ruler Daenerys. My feeling gravitated toward Brandon Broken (Isaac Hempstead Wright) around time became Three Eyed Raven. If seen series yet, might intrigued enough catch learning Cersei Lannister (Leana Heady) stated Ned Stark (Sean Bean) Episode #1.7 - "When play game thrones, win, die."

Review :Game Thrones follows good mix England's history give real feel major story line mixed magically fantasy. (ie wall Romans built around Scotland) Like The Sopranos H B O made fresh, cutting edge, raw series. Regrettably later years series becomes formulated, redundant, hemmed in; much like Walking Dead series. Does anyone watch Walking Dead anymore? Well killing lead characters, introduction new characters creates new life series. Regrettable second half Game Thrones loses steam like series. 7 10 stars.

Review :Final Episode:If producers production team going take Star Wars Disney, expect hope filled promos absolutely saccharin fulfillment. After Jon Snow kills Daenerys simple behest Tyrion dragon burns evil throne, I enough. The dragon took angst burning chair? Pleeeeeease! These writers producers fined jailed misappropriation creativity guise story telling. JRR must fuming followed turned mass misdirection, bad writing sophomoric plot lines mostly went nowhere.Here couple glaring examples: Arya Stark mission kill queen. Plot line forgotten. Jon Snow really Targarian. Plot line forgotten. Bram, can't ruler he's 3-eyed crow see everything, suddenly becomes ruler can't kids? Plot line forgotten twisted get ending lead people expect anything more. There Starks Sansa queen north? Horrible outcome. Arya goes adventure West one ever gone before? In Westros, world must flat flat-earther's say one would suspect going fall edge. What happened Citadel? They guys get right: They thousands years survived Ice Walkers before. Why would Samwell ever think world would end something? Indeed, Ice Walkers went rather easily hands young girl great character stripped absolutely stupid, egotistical producers writers looking get thing leaving prospects spin-offs. What colossal joke could real theatrical artistic statement.The show ends Jon going Wildlings befriended saved part, Ice Walkers. Here's show ended:Sansa Stark heads north soldiers brought. Arya killed Daenarys exiled sent West supposedly boogy-men monsters exist. Jon goes back wreck Ft. Black, discovers total mess heads Wildlings.Then Tyrion others sit boring meeting try figure rebuild Kings Landing manage crops, what's left military run day-in-day-out operations large society people interdependent other. Somebody going clean get rid bodies restore semblance sanity people repopulate. Food come somewhere important get brothels going again. That would fitting. Forty-five minutes tedious business meeting cap two seasons creativity took place producers writers league 13-year old middle school student could done better.I'm going take segue battle Ice Walkers. Here beginning battle. Daenarys allowed Dothraki (sp) front lines. They going charge Army Dead estimated 500K strong. Nobody thinks kind strategy. They rush battle creatures can't killed get killed themselves, come back soldiers Dead Army. So let rush headlong fight going accomplish ultimate goal getting Ice Walker King front Bram bait Ice Walker King can't resist touched once?The thing affirmed battle many others fought absolute superiority Air Power agains light infantry kind. Overall, whoever stages battles fined misrepresentation skill.Penultimate Episode:I idea writers producers thinking. It must something like this: "Hey, we've made lot money far let's pull plug creative idea concept conflict resolution, pocket cash get Dodge stupid audience figures totally ripping off.Somehow, creative side series managed take compelling story minor episodic flaws left groaning turned series woman's year memorial insipid men around powerful women.This series turned colossal joke parody itself. One striking moment Brothers fighting similar light saber scenes "Revenge Sith."They somehow managed turn one compelling female roles, Arya Stark weak screaming little girl faced mortality. Gone revenge-seeking heroine slayed Ice Walker King Walter Frey kind survived ego-bruising initiation so-called "league" assassins survived endless situations would driven people mad, like loosing sight beheading father. Now find creative non-geniuses charge character development managed stick Devolvement machine "Mario Bros." eliminate life experience reduce sniveling little girl running life. It's bad conceptually insulting.Forget one whit military strategy could win battle people survive situations shouldn't. Jaime died several times dead come back life Westros that's episodic TV. It's medieval "Supernatural" foolish plot contrivances. But forgiven.What can't forgiven turning good, compelling story "Dungeons Dragons" remake without humor original. I watched degree expectation developers characters Samwell Lanisters could resolve potential final battles degree sophistication. But, alas, played colossal joke pretty devoted audience.I rate five starts last two seasons, pretty good story unfolding kept lot people watching. All I ask is: "What hell happened?"
